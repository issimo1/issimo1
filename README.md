# Hi there, I'm Teng Ma 👋

## Cloud Native Specialist | Golang Backend Developer

I am a backend engineer specializing in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Unlike typical web developers, I dive deep into the infrastructure layer—analyzing K8s source code, hacking the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), and building automated orchestration tools.

## 🛠 Technical Stack

Languages: Golang (Expert), Shell Scripting

Cloud Native: Kubernetes, Docker, Containerd, CRI-tools, Sonobuoy

Automation: Kubean, Kubespray, ClusterLoader2

Backend: Gin, gRPC, MySQL, Redis

## 🔭 Current Focus

My recent work revolves around Kubernetes Conformance and Cluster Automation:

K8s Conformance Testing: Developing custom plugins for Sonobuoy to verify orchestration and runtime standards.

CRI Tooling: Encapsulating cri-tools with gRPC for remote endpoint monitoring.

Hybrid Clusters: Automating mixed-architecture (x86/ARM) deployments using Kubean.
