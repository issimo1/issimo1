Hi there, I'm Teng Ma 👋

☁️ Cloud Native Specialist | 🐹 Golang Backend Developer

I am a backend engineer specializing in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Unlike typical web developers, I dive deep into the infrastructure layer—analyzing K8s source code, hacking CRI (Container Runtime Interface), and building automated orchestration tools.

I am passionate about Open Source, infrastructure stability, and scalable architectures.

🔭 What I've been working on

My recent work focuses on Kubernetes Conformance and Cluster Automation at DaoCloud:

🧪 K8s Conformance Testing: Led secondary development of Sonobuoy, creating custom plugins for E2E verification of orchestration, runtimes, and registries.

🔧 CRI Tooling Innovation: Encapsulated cri-tools with a gRPC layer to enable remote endpoint monitoring, solving the local socket limitation for distributed testing.

🚀 Hybrid Cluster Automation: Architected automated deployment solutions using Kubean, supporting seamless mixed-architecture (x86/ARM) provisioning via declarative APIs.

⚡ Performance Engineering: Orchestrated large-scale benchmarks using Kubemark and ClusterLoader2 to simulate high concurrency.

🚀 Featured Projects

Here are some projects that showcase my understanding of Go and Kubernetes internals:

Custom K8s Controller (Personal Project)

Developed a CRD and Controller based on sample-controller.

Implemented advanced version control, rollback capabilities, and data persistence logic.
